    # Complex fixes or a ton of issues (>100 issues)

      # - type_name (91 issues) - complex because we need to rename stuff
      # - cyclomatic_complexity (132 issues)
        # A somewhat complex fix, because we need extract functions into smaller functions to avoid overly complex logic, but I think this should be enabled in the future so that we can refactor our code to make sure our functions are small, simple, and adhere to the SOLID principles.

    # Not sure if we should implement

      # - class_delegate_protocol (4 issues)
      # - compiler_protocol_init (3 issues)
      # - discouraged_direct_init (2 issues)
        # Using `UIDevice()` directly is discouraged, but we're currently using it to check whether or not the device is an iPad by doing this `UIDevice().iPadDevice`
      # - force_cast
      # - force_try (2 issues)
        # I think both force try and force casting is OK at some cases, as long as we're using it appropriately and not abusing it
      # - inclusive_language (2 issues)
      # - nesting (14 issues)
      # - notification_center_detachment (5 issues)
      # - void_function_in_ternary (13 issues)
        # This is something that has been discussed and I need to know you guys' opinions on the rule.

    # Should be implemented, but not sure about how much the config values should be

      # - large_tuple (14 issues, max 2 members)
      # - file_length (40 issues, max 400 lines)
      # - type_body_length (47 issues, max 250 lines)
      # - function_body_length (43 issues, max 50 lines)
      # - function_parameter_count (68 issues, max 5 parameters)
      # - line_length (4202 issues, max of 120 characters)
      
    # We don't want to implement (not necessary, I think)
      # - trailing_whitespace (17200 issues, mindblown)
      # - leading_whitespace (398 issues)
      # - identifier_name (427 issues)
